# Feast Push
Empower your Feast feed reader to receive real-time updates with Feast Push.
Feast Push is based on the [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)
open protocol, which is used by millions of sites worldwide, including
WordPress.com and Tumblr (with thanks to [Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com)).

## Important Note
Feast Push is still in development and has not been tested fully yet.
